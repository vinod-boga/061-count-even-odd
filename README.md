# Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.

Define a function that takes a list of numbers as a parameter and returns a dictionary in the form {'ODD': x, 'EVEN': y}
where x and y represent the number of odd and even numbers in the sequence respectively.

_Example:_

**Input:**

`[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]`


**Output:**


`{'ODD': 4, 'EVEN': 2}`
